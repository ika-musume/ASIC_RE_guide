# ASIC reverse engineering guide
CC-BY

This repository covers how to reverse engineer ASICs from the late-70s to the mid-90s. Most of this page is machine translated, and while I check the content before writing, there may be unnatural wording or grammatical errors. My memory may also be faulty, or there may be information that is not factually correct.
